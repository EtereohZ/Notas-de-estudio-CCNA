It's a network contained within a relatively small area, like an office floor or a home.
A more specific definition: A LAN is a single **broadcast domain**, includes all devices in that broadcast domain.
We can connect LAN's through a [[Router]].

Equipos dentro de una LAN se comunican mediante un [[Switch|switch]].
